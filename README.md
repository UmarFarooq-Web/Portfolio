# 🌟 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my **personal developer portfolio** built with **React.js**.  
It showcases my skills, projects, and contact info in a clean, modern layout — with glowing UI elements, smooth animations, and an interactive **particle background** built using the `<canvas>` element.
